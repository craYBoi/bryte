			<div class="small_padding"></div>
			<p class="small_font">Bryte Photo was started by two Brown students who weren’t happy with the LinkedIn photo options available to them.  They set out to create a better LinkedIn experience for students and designed a “pose-flow” and camera equipment setup that produced amazing LinkedIn photos.  After offering this experience on Brown’s Main Green, the founders received hundreds of requests around campus for their LinkedIn photos.  Now, they’ve grown to other schools and teach their LinkedIn photo-taking formula to keen photographers.</p>

			<div class="medium_padding"></div>
			<h2 class="landing_title_third">Free equipment</h2>
			<div class="small_padding"></div>
			<p class="small_font">We provide you with the lighting and backdrop equipment you’ll need to take LinkedIn photos.  You’ll get a golf-bag-sized duffel bag to carry it to and from photoshoots.  To become a Bryte Photographer, all you need is your own camera and tripod!</p>

			<h2 class="landing_title_third">Hear it from Our Photographers</h2>
			<div class="small_padding"></div>
			<p class="small_font">One of our photographers made $800 over five, 5-hour-photoshoots last semester. </p>
