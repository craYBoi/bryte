Descriptions of Projects may include compensation, ownership rights, deadline, delivery timeline commitments, and required Deliverables ("Project Description"). "Deliverables" mean all work created, developed or supplied by Independent Contractor in connection with your services and each Project, whether as finished products or work in process, including writings of any kind, audio-visual works, user interfaces, "look and feel," artwork, illustrations, images, photographs, printed or graphic matter, trademarks (including service marks, trade dress, trade names, logos, and domain names), works of authorship, preparatory materials, charts, diagrams, memoranda, drafts, sketches, outlines, developments, materials, data, inventions (whether patentable or not), trade secrets, improvements, processes, discoveries, compositions, methodologies, program materials, notes, lists, compilations, manuscripts, pictorial materials, schematics, drawings, specifications, blueprints, flowcharts, schematics, protocols, designs, design rights, plans, proposals, technical data, financial and marketing plans, as well as all Intellectual Property Rights, whether foreign or domestic, in each of the foregoing.

2. Staffing <br>
Casual Summary: If you include other assistants during a Project, you are responsible for their actions and for paying them. <br>Independent Contractor will supervise and control its Personnel (i.e., those who work for you either as employees or subcontractors) and represents and warrants that when employing or subcontracting with third parties, it does so as a legally recognized entity or person and in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations pertaining to hire and/or contract employees and/or independent contractors (a "Bureau").

(ii) Independent Contractor will require and cause its Personnel to assign to Independent Contractor all materials prepared, developed, and/or used by such Personnel in connection with, relating to, or regarding each Project, including all "moral rights" and Prior Inventions (defined below) therein.

Independent Contractor agrees to give Bryte Photo and any person designated reasonable assistance, required to perfect the rights granted pursuant to the Agreement.

Bryte Photo will retain and may exercise all of its rights and elections under the Bankruptcy Code or equivalent legislation in any other jurisdiction. (iv) If in the course of performing the services, Independent Contractor incorporates into any Deliverable or utilizes in the performance of the services any pre-existing invention, discovery, original works of authorship, development, improvement, trade secret, concept, or other proprietary information or Intellectual Property Right owned by Independent Contractor or in which Independent Contractor has an interest ("Prior Inventions"), Independent Contractor agrees that (a) Independent Contractor will provide Bryte Photo with prior written notice thereof, and (b) Bryte Photo is hereby granted a nonexclusive, royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable, transferable, worldwide license (with the right to grant and authorize sublicenses) to make, have made, use, import, offer for sale, sell, reproduce, distribute, modify, adapt, prepare derivative works of, display, perform, and otherwise exploit such Prior Inventions, without restriction, including as part of or in connection with such Deliverable, and to practice any method related thereto.

This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time. We will notify you of any material change by posting the new Privacy Policy to the Web site. You are advised to consult this policy regularly for changes.<br><br>

As used in this policy, the terms “using” and “processing” information include using cookies on a computer, subjecting the information to statistical or other analysis and using or handling information in any way, including, but not limited to collecting, storing, evaluating, modifying, deleting, using, combining, disclosing and transferring information within our organization or among our affiliates within the United States or internationally.<br><br>

Information Collected<br>
While visiting the Web site we may ask you to register and/or provide information that personally identifies you (“Personal Information”) to allow us to provide and improve our Web site, services, features and content (together, the “Service”) and to enable users to enjoy and easily navigate the Web site. Such Personal Information includes your name, company name, company url, phone number, street address, e-mail address and, for certain services, credit card information(notwithstanding anything else in this Privacy Policy, we will not share any credit card information with any third party unless required to provide you services that you have requested). On any page that collects Personal Information, we will specifically describe what information is required in order to provide you with the product or service, enter you in the promotion you have requested, or respond to your inquiry or comment. Information collected online is often defined as being either anonymous or personally identifiable:<br><br>

1. Anonymous Information refers to information that cannot be tied back to a specific individual. For instance, we may know that thousands of people have visited this Privacy Policy web page, but we do not necessarily know their names, where they live, or their date of birth. What we collect from visits such as this constitutes anonymous information. Many of the individuals who access our services decline to use the personalization features that are available to them, and therefore those individuals are anonymous to us and the only data we collect about them is anonymous information.<br><br>

2. Personal Information refers to information that tells us specifically who you are, such as your name, email address or phone number. In many cases we need this information to provide the personalized or enhanced service that you have requested. We hope that, like many of our customers, you will find it beneficial to provide Personal Information to Bryte Photo so that we may provide valuable services to you. Visiting the Web site will also cause a cookie to be issued; this cookie allows Bryte Photo to “recognize” you when you are on our site to allow us to personalize our service for you.<br><br>

Anonymous Information: As is true of most web sites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data. We use this information, which does not identify individual users, to analyze trends, to administer the site, to track users’ movements around the site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. We may link this automatically-collected data as well as any information received from third parties to Personal Information.<br><br>

Personal Information: In order to use the basic features of this Web site, you need not register or provide any Personal Information. We believe in protecting your privacy, and will not share Personal Information with third parties except as described in this Privacy Policy. We believe we can enhance your experience on our Web site with the information you share with us. We use Personal Information about you to improve our advertising and marketing efforts, to statistically analyze Web site usage, to improve our content and product offerings and to personalize the Web site’s content, layout, and services. We may also use your Personal Information, such as your e-mail address or mailing address, to contact you regarding products and/or services that may be of interest to you, to respond to an inquiry from you regarding the information that we have collected, or respond to your comments and suggestions. While we believe these services will enhance your experience at our Web site, you will at all times be able to opt out from receiving these communications (other than in response to your inquiries, comments and suggestions), either by specifically opting out of these services (by unsubscribing or clicking on this link and following the steps indicated) or, if applicable, by deleting your profile from our database. We also may disclose aggregated user statistics in order to describe our services to potential advertisers, partners, other third parties, our affiliate companies, and for other lawful purposes.<br><br>

We may also offer other services as a part of our Web site (e.g., contests, sweepstakes and other promotions with unaffiliated third parties). If you choose to use these optional services or opportunities, we may provide some of your Personal Information to these parties. We will not do so without telling you in advance, and you can avoid having us make such disclosures by choosing not to use these services or features of the Web site.<br><br>

Depending on the services you have chosen to use, some or all of your Personal Information may be used by Bryte Photo to provide such services. Personal Information may also be provided to intermediaries and third parties, including credit card processors, who assist Bryte Photo in providing you with the service you request.
