					</div>
					<p class="landing_text red">Bryte began its partnership with Rhode Island College in 2016 to provide free headshots to Rhode Island College students. Bryte and Rhode Island College began their partnership with a single shoot in June, 2016 shortly after partnering together. The shoot took place in the Career Development Center at Rhode Island College and the students who attended got headshot experiences they were happy with. The Career Development Center members were particularly excited about having Bryte’s shoot at their Center since it was newly renovated and the student body had an opportunity to visit it and spend more time with their career counselors. The success of the shoot on all levels lead the Rhode Island College Career Development Center to partnering with Bryte to do regular shoots during the upcoming academic year.</p>

						<h2 class="landing_title_sec">Bryte's Student Photographer</h2>
					</div>
					<p class="landing_text">Bryte uses student photographers to take headshots at its shoots. When Bryte partners with a new school, it reaches out to the student photographers through the Career Center to advertise to students about the photography experience they new have the opportunity for. Students are excited about this job and Bryte typically receives many applications from students at the school it partners with. At Rhode Island College, Bryte partnered with Linda Lin, a Graphic Design Major, who took excellent pictures on shoot day. Linda took the students through multiple poses as taught in Bryte’s unique "pose-flow" and also demonstrated an excellent ability to handle the administrative tasks of the shoot. The various professional skills Linda displayed throughout the shoot made the experience a rewarding and educational one for her.</p>
