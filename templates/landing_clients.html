						</div>
						<p class="landing_text red">In May 2016, CareerLAB, the career services center at Brown University, did a pilot shoot with Bryte to take headshots for Brown University students. To advertise the shoot, CareerLAB posted once on their Facebook Page and sent out a single email to Brown Undergraduates. The response was unbelievable: in 94 minutes all 40 headshots on the Bryte website were booked. The next 24 hours saw 208 email signups from students requesting waitlist spots for the shoot. Between the exciting response from students, and an excellent solution provided by Bryte, CareerLAB proceeded to purchase another 60 headshots in May 2016, and also hired Bryte for 5 more shoots during the Fall 2016 Semester.</p>

						</div>
						<p class="landing_text red">Bryte began its partnership with Rhode Island College in 2016 to provide free headshots to Rhode Island College students. Bryte and Rhode Island College began their partnership with a single shoot in June, 2016 shortly after partnering together. The shoot took place in the Career Development Center at Rhode Island College and the students who attended got headshot experiences they were happy with. The Career Development Center members were particularly excited about having Bryte’s shoot at their Center since it was newly renovated and the student body had an opportunity to visit it and spend more time with their career counselors. The success of the shoot on all levels lead the Rhode Island College Career Development Center to partnering with Bryte to do regular shoots during the upcoming academic year.</p>

						<p class="landing_text">Bryte uses student photographers to take headshots at its shoots. When Bryte partners with a new school, it reaches out to the student photographers through the Career Center to advertise to students about the photography experience they new have the opportunity for. Students are excited about this job and Bryte typically receives many applications from students at the school it partners with. At Rhode Island College, Bryte partnered with Linda Lin, a Graphic Design Major, who took excellent pictures on shoot day. Linda took the students through multiple poses as taught in Bryte’s unique "pose-flow" and also demonstrated an excellent ability to handle the administrative tasks of the shoot.</p>

						<p class="landing_text green">Bryte's partnership with CCRI began with a pilot shoot that took place on July 21st, 2016. The Pilot Shoot took place in the Great Hall of the CCRI Warwick campus. The location of the shoot drew excitement from students walking by as many stopped to see their friends taking headshots. Some even stopped what they were doing to take a headshot themselves! The members of the Career Planning office also had a great time at the shoot. Many of the members stopped by to take Bryte headshots for their own Linkedin profiles. It was a lively afternoon and the Career Planning office and Bryte decided to move forward with additional shoots for the upcoming semesters. Bryte and CCRI are looking forward to taking photos for lots of smiling professionals on campus!</p>

						<p class="landing_text">The Career Planning office is adjacent to the Great Hall. Bryte set up right by the office and the Career Planning Staff was able to interact with students throughout the event. As Bryte and CCRI staff interacted with students throughout the event, they found an incredible fact. 100% of the students were coming to a Career Planning event for the first time! The students were excited to meet the Career Planning staff and also received Linkedin handouts from the office. The students asked questions to the Career Planning staff and learned more about both Linkedin and future events where they could continue to learn about it. The headshot event was a great segway for connecting students to their campuses.</p>
